        <h1>Pari Sharma</h1>
        <h2> Second-year Computer Science student trying to keep up with deadlines.</h2>
        <p class="bio">Pari is a sophomore CS student who genuinely enjoys learning but constantly feels buried under assignments, GitHub projects, and course notifications. She keeps switching between planners and apps, yet still forgets tasks and ends up working late at night to catch up.</p>

                    <li>I organize everything on Sunday but by Wednesday its already chaos.</li>
                    <li>I use Notion, Google Calendar, and sticky notes and still miss something.</li>
                    <li>When I fall behind, I avoid opening the planner because it stresses me out.</li>
